# **Electronic longboard**
This electronic longboard canreach speeds of about 40km/hr and run for about 18km.

***BLDC motors:*** its an electronically commuted DC motor which does not have brushes. The controller provides pulses of current to the motor windings which control the speed and torque of the motor.it has high speed, elctronic control and low maintenance. BLDC motors have long been used in industrial applications such as actuators, feed drives for CNC machines, industrial robots, extruder drives, among others.

***ESC:*** Electronic Speed Controller controls the brushless motor movement or speed by activating the appropriate MOSFETs to create the rotating magnetic field so that the motor rotates. The higher the frequency, higher the speed of motor will be. The ESC gets the commands from the receiver that tells it how much the remote's throttle is pushed. It then controls the amount of energy that passes from the battery to the motor, hence controlling the motor's speed.
