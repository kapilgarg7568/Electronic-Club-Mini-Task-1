Raspberry Pi GPS tracker:-->
its a simple Raspberry Pi GPS tracker and real time web interface based on Raspberry Pi which tracks the position.
we will use a gps module here.
GPS Module:GPS receivers use a constellation of satellites and ground stations to compute position and time almost anywhere on earth. ... With this information and some math, a ground based receiver or GPS module can calculate its position and time.
we have a GPS module with a serial communication that we will read on raspberry and show it on a HTML web page.
For reading from the module we have to write a simple python code to get longitudes and latitudes
