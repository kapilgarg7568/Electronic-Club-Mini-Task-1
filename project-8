Pi camera:The Pi camera module is a portable light weight camera that supports Raspberry Pi. It communicates with Pi using the MIPI camera serial interface protocol. It is normally used in image processing, machine learning or in surveillance projects. It is commonly used in surveillance.

PIR motion sensor:passive infrared sensor (PIR sensor) is an electronic sensor that measures infrared (IR) light radiating from objects in its field of view. They are most often used in PIR-based motion detectors. PIR sensors are commonly used in security alarms and automatic lighting applications.The detector itself does not emit any energy but passively receives it, detects infrared radiation from the environment.
