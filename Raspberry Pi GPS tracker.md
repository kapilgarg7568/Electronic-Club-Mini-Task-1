# **Raspberry Pi GPS tracker**
its a simple Raspberry Pi GPS tracker and real time web interface based on Raspberry Pi which tracks the position.
we will use a gps module here.
we have a GPS module with a serial communication that we will read on Raspberry and show it on a HTML web page.
For reading from the module we have to write a simple Python code to get longitudes and latitudes
