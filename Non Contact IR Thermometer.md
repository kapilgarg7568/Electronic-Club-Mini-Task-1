# **Non Contact IR Thermometer**
its a project to measure the temperature of a body that is not safe to touch so this device measure temperature of body using IR thermal sensor and report the result on your OLED screen. it can be used to measure component temperatures, measuring body temperature, surface temperature, Heat ventilation and much more. But there is a limitation that we have to keep this device close to the part of which temp we want to know because the limitation of sensor.

###### ***OLED screen***
(Organic Light Emitting Device, Organic Light Emitting Diode) A display technology that offers bright, colorful images with a wide viewing angle, low power, high contrast ratio and fast response time for sports and action movies.

###### ***Laser Diode***
its a similar semiconductor device to LED but can directly convert electrical energy into light and emits more converged light in comparison to LED. laser diodes give high efficiency with low thresold current. We are using this here to know that where the sensing area of sensor is pointing at.

###### ***MLX90614 IR thermal sensor***
The MLX90614 is a Contactless Infrared (IR) Digital Temperature Sensor that can be used to measure the temperature of a particular object ranging from -70° C to 382.2°C. The sensor uses IR rays to measure the temperature of the object without any physical contact and communicates to the microcontroller using the I2C protocol. it can be used in industries to measure the temperature of moving objects like a rotating motor shaft. Due to its high accuracy and precision, it is also used in a wide range of commercial, health care, and household applications like room temperature monitoring, body temperature measurement, etc.

###### ***I2C protocol***
I2C is a serial protocol for two-wire interface to connect low-speed devices like microcontrollers, EEPROMs, A/D and D/A converters, I/O interfaces and other similar peripherals in embedded systems.
