Voice Controlled Light Bulb:-->
in this project our aim is to make a light bulb circuit which we can controll by our voice on our phone.
So to make this project we are going to connect a light bulb to power supply and Evive through relay (common and normally open in this case) which will keep the circuit open till the signal is not recieved to close the circuit. 
We will be using PictoBlox for writing our code and Dabble to send the data to evive recieved from smartphone which and this will give command to relay accordingly.

Evive: (Arduino based embedded paltform) IoT kit gets you started with amazing hands-on experience projects in the field of Internet of Things (IoT). It enables you to connect your hardware with internet or Bluetooth devices or smartphone.

PictoBlox: its a Scratch 3.0-based graphical programming software that is the ideal companion for the setting the first step into the world of programming. Its user-friendly interface and comes with drag-and-drop functionality.

Dabble: This App transforms your Smartphone into a virtual I/O device and lets you control hardware using Bluetooth, communicate with it, access sensors like accelerometer, GPS, proximity and other features of your Smartphone. You can use Dabble as a Bluetooth Controller App for Arduino Uno-Mega-Nano, ESP32, and evive for making various DIY projects or IoT applications.
