# **Soil Moisture Display**
This project is way to the test the moisture content of display it without conneceting arduino to computer. for this purpose we can install a _single digit seven segment display_ on arduino board itself.

###### ***Soil Moisture Sensor with Control Unit***
It consists of two parts: The main Sensor and the Control Board. Sensor part of the Soil Moisture Sensor consists of a couple of conductive probes that can be used to measure the volumetric content of water in soil. control board is made up of LM393 IC, which is a voltage comparator. The board also consists of all the necessary components like connectors, LEDs, resistors etc. to measure the Soil Moisture.

###### ***LM393 IC***
The LM393 is a dual differential comparator. that means that it accepts 2 inputs for comparison.It compares these voltage inputs and determines which is the larger value. Based on this, electronic decisions can be made based on which input is greater and which is smaller.

###### ***single digit seven segment display***
A seven-segment display is a form of electronic display device for displaying decimal numerals that is an alternative to the more complex dot matrix displays.
Seven-segment displays are widely used in digital clocks, electronic meters, basic calculators, and other electronic devices that display numerical information.
