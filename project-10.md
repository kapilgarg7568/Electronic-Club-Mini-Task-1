Water Level Indicator:--> its a simple project based on Arduino board which will show water level on display and remind us by a buzzer when water tank is empty or full.

JNS-SR04 water proof ultrasonic module: its quite similar to HC-SR04 sensor bur it has waterproof probe. it emits wave and recieves when reflected back after hitting an obstacle and we can calculate time using the width of echopulse. we already know the speed of sound so we can calculate the distance and convert it into the water percent present in the tank.
