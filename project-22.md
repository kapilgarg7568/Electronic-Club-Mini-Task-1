Portable Metal Detector:-->
This is a cheap and easy portable meatal detector using a coil and 555 timer circuit. It uses a green led for signalling and alert us by an alarm sound.

Components Required:
1 - NE555
1 - 1mH coil (I've reduced the value from 10mH to save some copper assembling my own coil, because less inductance => less wire spins)
2 - 2.2uF electrolyte Capacitors
1 - 10uF electrolyte Capacitor
1 - 47K resistor
1 - 8R speaker
1 - pressure button switch SPST NO
1 - 9V battery
Optional components:
1 - green LED
1 - 330R resistor
1 - 10K potentiometer

first we have to make a coil using copper wire that can be done with the help of any round box of required diameter.
here we are using an extra led for signalling in the 555 timerand a potentiometer to adjust the volume of the sound in speaker.
now its all ready to detect an object.

The 555 timer IC: it is an integrated circuit used in a variety of timer, pulse generation, and oscillator applications. The 555 can be used to provide time delays, as an oscillator, and as a flip-flop element. Derivatives provide two or four timing circuits in one package.

electrolytic capacitor: it is a polarized capacitor whose anode or positive plate is made of a metal that forms an insulating oxide layer through anodization. A solid, liquid, or gel electrolyte covers the surface of this oxide layer, serving as the cathode or negative plate of the capacitor
