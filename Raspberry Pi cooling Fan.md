# **Raspberry Pi cooling Fan**
its a quite simple project in which we can put the fan over heat sink using zipties and plug the fan on GPIO using 5V and GND and when Pi is powered, fan will start working.

***GPIO:***
(General Purpose Input Output) Singal digital pin on an integrated circuit board.

***Heatsink:***
Heatsink is a passive heat exchanger that transfers heat. The heatsink is typically a metallic part which can be attached to a device releasing energy in the form of heat, with the aim of dissipating that heat to a surrounding fluid in order to prevent the device overheating.
