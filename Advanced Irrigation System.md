# **Advanced IoT Irrigation System** 
This IoT based system involves humidity and temperature sensor which keep tracks the current atmosphere of the system and has an influence when watering happens.
This system requires an Arduino UNO which acts as controller and server of the whole system on the basis of weather condition like moisture in soil and humidity conditions present. In This Plant irrigation System, Soil Moisture Sensor checks the moisture level in the soil and if moisture level is low than a certain thresold then Arduino switches which is connected to a water pump, turn it On to provide water to the plant. Water pump gets automatically off when system finds enough moisture in the soil. Whenever system switched On or off the pump, a message is sent to the user via GSM module, updating the status of water pump and soil moisture. This system is very useful in Farms, gardens, home etc. This system is completely automated.

###### ***SIM800L***
it is a miniature cellular module which allows for GPRS transmission, sending and receiving SMS and making and receiving voice calls. Low cost and small footprint and quad band frequency support make this module perfect solution for any project that require long range connectivity.
