Continuously Rotating Solar Motor:-->
Aim of this project is to make an objecet which can be in motion continuously and this pulse motor runs for a very long time.
Light on the solar panel charges a super capacitor via a low-dropout regulator. A Hall sensor detects the rotor magnet. The pulse passes the pulse shaper, comperator and driver IC (3 in one) and activates the pulse coil.
The two spheres are from an embroidery frame. Magnetic bearings are used to reduce the friction of the rotor shaft to a minimum. A mattres needle with a very sharp point is doing the job. The rotor is made from a styrofoam globe and has 5 magnets placed around the middle
The power supply by a small solar panel and a supercap as energy storage have proven that this pulse motor can run for a very long time. It is a challenge to go batteryless. Ultra low power circuits and supercaps makes it possible.

Hall effect sensor: it is a device that is used to measure the magnitude of a magnetic field. Its output voltage is directly proportional to the magnetic field strength through it. Hall effect sensors are used for proximity sensing, positioning, speed detection, and current sensing applications.

TS881 Comperator: this device is a single comparator featuring ultra low supply current (210 nA typical with output high, VCC = 1.2 V, no load) with rail-to- rail input and output capability. The performance of this comparator allows it to be used in a wide range of portable applications.

IC XC6206 LOD: it is a low ESR capacitor compatible positive LDO voltage regulator from Torex semiconductor. The XC6206 series are highly precise, low power consumption, 3 terminal, positive voltage regulators manufactured using CMOS and laser trimming technologies. XC6206 voltage regulator has a current limiter circuit, a driver transistor, a precision reference voltage and an error correction circuit. Maximum operating voltage for XC6206 is 6V while the output voltage range is 1.2 V to 5 V.

Supercapacitor (SC): these are also called an ultracapacitor, is a high-capacity capacitor with a capacitance value much higher than other capacitors, but with lower voltage limits, that bridges the gap between electrolytic capacitors and rechargeable batteries. It typically stores 10 to 100 times more energy per unit volume or mass than electrolytic capacitors, can accept and deliver charge much faster than batteries, and tolerates many more charge and discharge cycles than rechargeable batteries.
