# **Simple Gesture Control with Movemetn of Arm for RC Toys**
we can simply control a RC stunt car with movement of our arm using tilt sensors.

***Tilt Sensors***

These sensors are used to measure slope and tilt within a limited range of motion Such types of sensors produce an electrical signal which is proportional to the degree of inclination with respect to one or more axes. These sensors play a very important role in several applications such as off road vehicles, portable computers, robotics devices, aviation instruments, etc.
