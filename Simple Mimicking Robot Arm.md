Simple Mimicking Robot Arm:
Its an Arduino based project aims to build a simple mimicking robot arm with very simple components mainly arduino, servos and potentiometers.

Components Required:
Arduino uno x1
Micro Servo motor x4
10k potentiometers x4
Robot Shield x1
Some sticks

Here we need to make two assemblies one is with the servo motors and another one is with potentiometers in which servo motor assembly arm will mimick the movements of potentiometer assembly arm.

And to make servo motor assembly we have to just glue all the servo motor with each other using hot glue and sticks in between shoulder and wrist joint and for potentiometer we have to repeat whole process with potentiometers.

we are making here an extra jaw for mimicking arm so that it can also lift some object and place it wherever we want and to make jaw we can simply heat an empty IC container and give it a round shape using a marker or pen and then glue it with jaw servo.

Now we will make all the connection with the help of Robot Shield. 

Circuit diagram for Robot Shield circuit:

Now its time to code so for that we have to upload the code to Arduino using USB cable.
