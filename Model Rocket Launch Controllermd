# **Model Rocket Launch Controller**
this controller sends all the wireless signals to control the launch pads systems and launch the rocket, but it also adjusts the settings of the launch. Whether it is actually launching, or just being held down to the pad for a static fire of the motor.
###### ***Components Required***
A case of some sort
Acrylic panel
Buttons and switches
LCD screen, voltage readout
PLA filament
3D carbon fibre vinyl
A speaker and audio module (if you want it to talk)

We need a some sort of security code to ensure that nobody else can launch it.
We will also need an emergency stop button because if anything go wrrong at the time of launch we can cut off power from the controller ensuring that rocket cant launch.
Now we need to build a circuit board on acrylic on the basis of each functionality of the controller and for that a good component list is eesential and we also need to keep in mind the other inputs and outputs such as switches, LED's and buzzers.
NOw coding part is left so for everyone software is going to be difffernt according to what their controller do.
