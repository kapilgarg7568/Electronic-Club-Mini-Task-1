Velocity Sensitive Keyboard:-->
Velocity Sensitive Cardboard Keyboard that works with proximity IR sensors. Depending on whether we play a piano key faster or slower, the musical note will sound more or less hard, respectively.

Components Required:
Arduino Mega
5 10k Ohm resistors
1 1k Ohm resistor
1 100 Ohm resistor
Cable
1 buzzer
5 reflective IR sensors,(QRE1113)
Universal pcb
Battery (optional)
Soldering iron
Tin
Caiman-caiman cable

first we have to Piano keys and Piano base by cutting cardboard with proper dimensions and then locate the rubber straps to piano keys to return to their original position.
Then for the circuit part first we have to cut pcb and put the IR sensors on them and then after wiring thsese piano keys to the arduino we have to upload the program to Arduino and once we connect the battery its ready to use.

The Arduino Mega: it is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega2560. It has 54 digital input/output pins (of which 14 can be used as PWM outputs), 16 analog inputs, 4 UARTs (hardware serial ports), a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started.
