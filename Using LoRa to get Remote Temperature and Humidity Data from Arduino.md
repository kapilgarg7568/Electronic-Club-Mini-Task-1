# **Using LoRa to get Remote Temperature and Humidity Data from Arduino**

***LoRa***
its a wireless communication module. its small in size, efficient, has a long communication range and mainly used for mutual communication between IoT terminals.

***Maduino LoRa radio***
it is a mainboard based on the ATmega328 and RFM95W 868MHz module. The LoRa Radio allows the user to send data and reach extremely long ranges at low data-rates. It provides ultra-long range spread spectrum communication and high interference immunity whilst minimizing current consumption.

***ATmega328*** 
its a single chip microcontroller. it is commonly used in many projects and autonomous systems where a simple, low-powered, low-cost micro-controller is needed[citation needed]. Perhaps the most common implementation of this chip is on the popular Arduino development platform, namely the Arduino Uno and Arduino.

***DHT11*** 
The DHT11 is a basic, ultra low-cost digital temperature and humidity sensor. It uses a capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor to measure the surrounding air, and spits out a digital signal on the data pin (no analog input pins needed). Its fairly simple to use, but requires careful timing to grab data.

***ThingSpeak*** its an IoT analytics platform service that allows you to aggregate, visulaize and analyze the live data streams in cloud.
